    "<b>1. Introduction</b>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "According to scientific research, pulsars are an uncommon form of neutron stars that emit regular pulses of radiation, varying from several seconds to milliseconds in frequency. The potent magnetic fields of these stars generate intense beams of light at both poles. These beams are periodically observed as the pulsar rotates quickly, and they can only be observed with large telescopes when they cross our line of sight from Earth (National Aeronautics and Space Administration, n.d.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Although pulsars emit a pattern of radio emission that can be detected as they rotate, it can be challenging to distinguish between genuine signals and background noise. Pulsar candidates are being classified as binary classification issues using machine learning tools. The HTRU 2 dataset, which is used to train classification models, includes examples of both real and fake pulsar signals. The class labels used are 0 (negative) and 1 (positive), with the legitimate pulsar examples being the minority positive class. The eight continuous variables are obtained from the integrated pulse profile and the DM-SNR (Disperion Measure-Signal-to-Noise Ratio) curve, which describes the longitude-resolved version of the signal averaged in both time and frequency (Keith et al., 2010). Each candidate in the dataset is described by eight continuous variables, one class variable, and no astronomical information. The integrated pulse profile and the DM-SNR curve are used to determine the eight variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we aim to produce a KNN classification model from the integrated pulse profile and DM-SNR curve of pulsar candidates to classify whether signals are legitimate or spurious (real or fake pulsar). The data will be used to explore the correlation between two variables, the class imbalance and the combination of predictors that would create a model with the greatest accuracy."

In addition, in contrast to what we had anticipated, we discovered that using 6 of the dataset's 8 available variables allowed us to create the most accurate classifier. This was unexpected because we had read in class that using either too few or too many predictors could reduce the classifier's accuracy, and we had anticipated that using 2-4 predictors would produce the highest accuracy.
